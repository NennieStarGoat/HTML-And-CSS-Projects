This will be a new repository for all my HTML and CSS work in my software bootcamp.

The aim for this repository will be a set of code I create and work on through the course, including all changes and updates so that I can get more familiar using Git and version control.

Technologies: CSS and HTML

Table of Contents: 
-Academy Cinemas - a movie website utilizing HTML and CSS styling, as well as a healthy dose of Bootstrap for creating a movie theatre's website playing classic movies.
